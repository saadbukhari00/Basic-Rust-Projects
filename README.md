### Basic RUST Projects

**Projects Overview:** <br>
This repository contains three basic Rust projects that I developed while learning Rust:
1. **SHA256 Password Cracker** - A program that attempts to crack SHA256 hashed passwords using a dictionary attack.
2. **URL Shortener** - A simple URL shortener that generates and stores short URLs corresponding to long URLs.
3. **Quiz Game** - A console-based quiz game that asks questions and calculates the score.

**Libraries and Tools Used:**
- **Rust Standard Library**: Provides basic functionalities like reading environment variables and handling I/O operations.
- **sha2**: A Rust crate used for generating SHA256 hashes.
- **rand**: A Rust crate for generating random values.
- **BufRead**: Used for reading lines from a file.

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Understanding how to work with files and read data line-by-line.
- Implementing basic cryptography using Rust libraries.
- Creating simple applications with input/output operations.
- Handling errors effectively and improving code reliability.

**Disclaimer:**
- These projects are for educational purposes and might contain basic implementations. They should not be used for production-level applications.
