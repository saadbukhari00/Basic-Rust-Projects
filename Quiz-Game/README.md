# Quiz Game

## Introduction:
This Rust project is a console-based quiz game that asks users three questions and calculates their score based on the correct answers.

## Features:
- Asks three multiple-choice questions.
- Provides immediate feedback on whether the user's answer is correct.
- Calculates the final score and displays it as a percentage.

## Usage:
```bash
cargo run
```

## How it works:
- The game presents three questions, each with multiple-choice answers.
- The user inputs their answer, and the game checks if itâ€™s correct.
- After all questions are answered, the game calculates the score as a percentage of correct answers.

## Potential Improvements:
- Add more questions and categories.
- Implement a scoring system that awards points based on question difficulty.
- Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more engaging experience.
